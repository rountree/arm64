New workflow:  binary patching.

Rather than work with a full xxd dump, create a series
of files that represent indivdiual patches to an existing
binary.  The naming convention for the file lists the
address affected and what that file does, e.g.,

    010c_010f__X29_to_stack_0x0_offset.xxc

The contents of that file look like

    # 3322 2222 2222 1111 1111 11
    # 1098 7654 3210 9876 5432 1098 7654 3210
    # ---------------------------------------
    # 0011 1000 000i iiii iiii 00nn nnnt tttt   STURB
    #              0 0000 0000   11 1111 1101
    #    3    8    0    0    0    3    f    d
    #
    # Store the contents of X29 on the stack
    #
    0000010c: fd03 0038

The make.me script strips out the comments and patches
the sturb binary.

The xxc.template file lists the binary patterns for
several common instructions.  The reader is expected
to be familar with what each field does.  Creating a
new patch should be as simple as copying the xxc.template
file and deleting everything you don't need.
